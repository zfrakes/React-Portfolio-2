                    <p className="content-text">Hello everyone, my name is Zoey Frakes. I was born and raised in Philadelphia, PA. I graduated from Pennsylvania State University, where I received a Bachelor of Science degree in Health Policy Administration. Although I lived in Philadelphia for most of my life, I spent a year living in Washington, D.C., after graduating from college. I have traveled a few other places but never really lived anywhere else. One of my goals in life is to visit every continent. Also, I want to visit every state in the United States. When I am not planning on traveling the world, I enjoy attending plays/ musicals, watching movies, arts and crafts, and spending time with family and friends. Currently, Iâ€™m enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania LPS Coding Boot Camp. I love to express my creativity by building layouts for web and mobile applications. Upon completion of this program, I plan to explore opportunities in User Experience Design and Front-End Development. If you or your company need help in designing beautiful and easy to navigate applications, I am your girl!</p>
